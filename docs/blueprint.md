## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke feelings of trust and knowledge. This bright color creates contrast with the dark background, but doesn't result in a garish effect.
- Background color: Dark blue (#1A263A) for a modern and professional feel, while also allowing other design elements to pop.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFDA63) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a clean and modern feel for readability.
- Use simple, line-based icons for easy recognition and a minimalist aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout for consistent spacing and structure across different screen sizes, incorporating rounded cards and subtle shadows for depth.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience, like fading in content or a slight scaling effect on button hover.
